# controlly

A Home Assistant dashboard application for wall-mounted tablets.

Due to current development efforts, UI configuration will be YAML-based and must be hosted on an HTTP endpoint. See example-config.yaml in this repository for a sample file.

Currently very in-progress and nowhere near functional yet.
## Plans
- Native UI widgets
- Grid layout so things line up nicely
- Integrated Snapcast client for synchronized TTS/audio playback
- Websocket API & companion Home Assistant integration for controlling hardware functions
- Digital picture frame "screensaver" capability
